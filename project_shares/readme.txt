This project is a bit of an experiment in bitcoin, open source, and reward systems. 

Every day 100 shares will be created for this project. They will then be issued anwhere between once a month to four times a month depending on how much activity is happening on the project.

50% of the shares will be issued to the project owner (sonofman), and the remainder will be divided up based on contributions to the project. Anyone submitting code, assets, QA help, etc will be given points based upon the value of their contributions. Points earned from the time of the last issuing of the stock by the person will be used to determine
the percentage of the total issued stocks that person earned (rounded to the nearest integer). So if you earned 25 points since the last shares were issued, and the total that all people earned was 100 points, you would be granted 75% of the 
shares that were not automatically issued to the project owner. The project owner can also be given points and granted
shares over the automatic 50% if he contributed to the project. Allocation of points is based upon the weighted average
of the points assigned by each team member based upon the number of shares he owns. 

All profits from the running of the site based on this project will be divided up based upon share ownership. Also, one of the first storefronts in the mainstreet site will be a stock system. Once up and running, the shares ownership that is recorded in the github repository will be transitioned over to that system, and share owners can sell their shares on the open marketplace. Beyond that, share owners will also be given voting rights.

This whole concept is experimental right now, and is totally subject to change and improved as long as those changes are for the betterment of the project and the shareholders.
