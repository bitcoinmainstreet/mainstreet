Bitcoin Mainstreet
==========

Bitcoin Mainstreet is a site that will contain multiple microsites:
* A stock/equity marketplace where you can create companies and by and sell shares
* An amazon like marketplace where users can buy and sell goods
* An elance or amazon turk type site where you can buy and sell services
* An auction site
* An app, music and video sales site

What is unique about Bitcoin Mainstreet:

The developers all own shares of the site, and shares are distributed depending on the developer's contributions to the site. Profits to the site are distributed to shareholders, so contributing to the development of the site is not just enjoyable, but potentially profitable. 

Shares are currently recorded in a spreadsheet in the github repositiory, but will eventually be transitioned to the first microsite,
which will be a stock trading marketplace. From there you can sell your shares to non-developers if you would like to cash out early.
